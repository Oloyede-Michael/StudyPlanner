# StudyPlanner

StudyPlanner is a project to help you organize and track your study activities efficiently. This repository consists of a frontend built with React and Vite.

## Features

- Minimal setup with React and Vite for fast development
- Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for instant feedback
- ESLint integration for code quality
- (Add additional features and details specific to your project here)

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or higher recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)
- (Add any additional prerequisites if needed)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Oloyede-Michael/StudyPlanner.git
   ```

### Running the Project

To start the development server, run:
```sh
g++ main.cpp -o server -lws2_32
```

This will launch the app in development mode. Open your browser and navigate to the URL provided in the terminal (typically `http://localhost:8080`).

### Building for Production

To create a production build:
```sh
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build locally with:
```sh
npm run preview
```

## Expanding the ESLint Configuration

If you want to clone the repo and develop to a production application, consider using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules. More information can be found in the [TS template for Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts).
